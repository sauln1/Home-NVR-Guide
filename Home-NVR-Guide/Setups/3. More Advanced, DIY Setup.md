#### Overview
This guide will go through a *very* DIY and technical setup at a broad level. I won't get into things like flashing firmware or ISO files or raspberry pi setups, I'll just be giving an overview with resource links to methods you can use to minimize cost by doing a lot of things yourself. NOTE: I have not done this, this guide is using resources found and recommended from the Home Assistant and Frigate communities.

## The Base Station
This setup will essentially follow my guide for my personal setup, so go through that guide to get Home Assistant set up with Proxmox and Frigate NVR. Ignore the parts about the Amcrest and Reolink cameras, we will be creating our own cameras here.

## The Cameras
I used [this guide](https://www.instructables.com/Raspberry-Pi-as-low-cost-HD-surveillance-camera/) to get an idea of how to create the Raspberry Pi cameras, so I encourage you to follow these steps to build the cameras our. Skip and steps or replace any steps you want to, you can especially be flexible with the casing for the cameras if you have access to a 3D Printer. You'll want to skip the steps that detail how to access it from anywhere as we'll be using Frigate NVR for this.

To do this, we'll need to set up an RTSP server to enable Frigate to access the Raspberry Pi cameras. [I found this guide to be recommended](https://kevinsaye.wordpress.com/2018/10/17/making-a-rtsp-server-out-of-a-raspberry-pi-in-15-minutes-or-less/) for the setup of an RTSP server. You could possibly use MediaMTX as an install on Proxmox [using the helper script](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=mediamtx), then connect that to your camera to create an RTSP stream as well.

Once you have an RTSP stream created for the camera, you can add that camera to frigate as RTSP using the steps detailed in my other guide for my personal setup or the Frigate documentation.

## Connect From Anywhere
For this, we'll be using [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXAwT9N-7Hw) which is the same guide I used to set up my Home Assistant instance to be accessible anywhere. I'd recommend subscribing to this guy as his channel is excellent for Home Assistant and Smart Home tutorials. You'll need to purchase a web domain for this. You can use the site he used, but I used squarespace for mine and it worked fine as well. I'd recommend using an uncommon domain address and avoid anything that ends with '.com' or '.org' as these tend to be the most expensive. Mine ends with .word and is $10 a year. There are a lot of sites out there as well so if squarespace isn't to your liking, just google for others.

Once you're set up and connected, you can use Home Assistant to access Frigate and view your camera streams pretty easily.
