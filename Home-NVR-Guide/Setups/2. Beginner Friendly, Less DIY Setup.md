#### Overview
This setup will focus on using the wifi capabilities of certain cameras to connect to your home network, but *not* utilize the subscriptions for those cameras. Many cameras allow you to do this and record video to SD cards and save it locally, but for obvious reasons (because they want you to buy their subscription) they won't tell you this. I'll cover doing this process for eufy and TP-Link. I will note that the obvious downside to this is that the storage of the videos relies on SD cards that are inside the cameras, meaning if someone wanted to get rid of the footage all they need to do is remove or destroy the card which, even if it's not readily available, is still much easier to do than if you set up an NVR or CCTV system that records to a central or cloud location you have set up like in the [My Personal Setup guide](https://github.com/sauln1/Home-NVR-Guide/blob/main/Home-NVR-Guide/Setups/1.%20My%20Personal%20Setup.md).

# eufy
eufy is a local first wifi camera which meansbs no sucriptions! The linked setup comes with a base station that connects your cameras wirelessly to it and stores the video there, so you get to avoid having to use SD cards in the camera itself. The major downside to this setup is it's very expensive. eufy is also owned by Anker, and I swear by Anker's products which is why I'm adding them to this guide.

Setup is pretty easy:
1. Mount the cameras wherever you want, make sure to allow sunlight to reach the panels on the top easily so the solar panels can keep the cameras charged.
2. Download the eufy app on your phone and go through the setup process.
3. Go through the app's setup process and set up the home base.
4. After this, you can add devices to the home base via the app's setup process.

You can add new cameras to this and I'd recommend getting a doorbell camera from them.

# TP-Link Tapo
The major downside to the TP-Link Tapo cameras is the need for an SD card inside the camera itself, lowering security as someone can just take or destroy the camera and you'll lose the footage. This can obviously be worked around with a cloud storage subscription, but I'll provide the step here for the SD card setup. The major upside to these cameras is the price, most TP-Link Tapo cameras are under $100 and don't require a base station or hub to operate.
It's also important to note that your Micro SD cards you purchase should be SDXC with a minimum of 64GB, and have to be micro SD cards to fit into most cameras. [Check out this video for what all the numbers and symbols mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV2Z5Ag6X2Y). I'd also recommend at least a v30 card for better quality video.

1. Insert the MicroSD card into the camera and mount the cameras wherever you want.
2. Download the app on your phone and go through the setup process, adding each camera one at a time.

That's it, you're done!
